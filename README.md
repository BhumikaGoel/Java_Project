# Java_Project_July2016

I created this registration form in high school, when I was learning core java and web development languages from an external institute, out of interest.
This java project, built directly in JFrames, is meant to be used as a manipulation applicaton to the student records in a database on the server
(previously created on my MacBook).

This application is used to update student records such as contact information, fee, installment due dates and courses in use, among other functions. 
Searches can be run using first names and/or last names. The application can distinguish between the same first names, and other real-life issues that may arise.

My main areas of interest, as an undergraduate in Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley, are in Backend Engineering, Machine Learning and Data Science.
